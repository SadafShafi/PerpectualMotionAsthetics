This is my first IoT project ever.
I did it along with other 2 Mechanical engineering and an Electrical Engineering students, namely

1.Hameem

2.Murhid

3.Ryan

4.Sadaf (Me)

This is a simple project where we build a pendulum wich is rotated in 2 directions using magnetic field and gives an illusion of perpectual motion if pused from either sides.
Now it has been planted at out university campus.

Following were used for it:
1) Arduino Uno
2) 2 Hall sensors
3) Coil to generate magnetic field
4) Power supply
